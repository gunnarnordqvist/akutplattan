# Akutplattan
Akutplattan is a digital tool designed to be used in medical centers to help visualizing the workflow during CPR situations. 

## Installation and deployment
To build the project, you need to: 
* install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Install [Angular/CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and run the command 'npm install -g @angular/cli'

Then, run the command 'ng build'. The dist/ directory that is created contains the web application and can be used for deployment. Alternatively, run the command 'ng serve --port X' to deploy the application locally via port X. If the '--port' flag is left out, the default port is set to 4200.
