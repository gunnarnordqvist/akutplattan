# Akutplattan
Akutplattan is a digital tool for use in hospitals during CPR situations. 

## Installation and deployment
To build the project, you need to 
* install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Install [Angular/CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and run 'npm install -g @angular/cli'

Then, run 'ng build'. The dist/ directory that is created contains the web application and can be used for deployment. Alternatively, run 'ng serve --port X' to deploy the application locally via port X. If the --port flag is left out, the default port is 4200.
