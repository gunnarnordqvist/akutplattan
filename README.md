## The git cycle
* Before starting working, make it a habit to always pull from the branch you are currently working on.

* Once there are files staged for commit:
 1. git add "filename1" "filename2" ...
 2. git commit -m "message" (alternatively, leave out the "m" flag and use your favourite editor)
 3. git pull (origin "branch_name")
 4. If any, resolve merge conflicts
 5. git push (origin "branch_name")
